"Cautionary note on the use of these data: these data include detailed estimates underlying the GDP-by-industry accounts published elsewhere on this website and in the Survey of Current Business. The Bureau of Economic Analysis does not include these detailed estimates in the published tables because their quality is significantly less than that of the higher-level aggregates in which they are included. Compared to these aggregates, the more detailed estimates are more likely to be either based on judgmental trends, on trends in the higher-level aggregate, or on less reliable source data."
